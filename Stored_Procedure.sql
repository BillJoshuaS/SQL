#Check if the procedure is created:
Show procedure status where Db = 'parks_and_recreation';

# Call the created Procedure:
CALL large_salaries();

# Now moving further we can utilize the parameter in a stored procedure to filter out or search a specific item from the contents of the procedure:

DELIMITER //
Create Procedure pick_out(emp_id INT)
Begin
	Select salary
    From employee_salary
    Where employee_id = emp_id;
End//
DELIMITER ;

Show Procedure Status Where Db = 'parks_and_recreation';

Call pick_out(1);

# Note:
-- If you define multiple parameters in your procedure, you must pass all of them when calling it. Always match the number of paramters created in the procedure. 

-- Not doing so results in Error 1318.

-- MySQL doesn't support default parameter values like some other databases (e.g., PostgreSQL), so youâ€™ll need to handle it manually using IF ELSE statement.

-- IF dept IS NULL THEN
--   -- Skip filtering by dept_id
-- ELSE
--   -- Apply the condition
-- END IF;
